<h1>80s Gif Extravaganza</h1>

<p>This is an app to run some gifs using an API. As a child of the 80s, I love my music and sharing it with others, so this app helps to accomplish that. User clicks one of the pre-loaded buttons and will see up to 10 gif stills. User can click each image to animate the gif, then click them again to pause them. The user has the option to enter a singer or band of his/her choice in the text box, which will then create a button for the singer/band entered in the text box. When the new button is clicked, it will load the page with related gifs.</p>
